                <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we
                    provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
                    choices you can make about the way your information is collected and
                    used.</p>
                <p>Please note that participation in the ScreenMe Sites is primarily a
                    public activity and much of the information you post to any ScreenMe Sites
                    (whether directly through our site or via links with other social
                    networking websites) is instantly publicly viewable. Therefore, you
                    should not submit information that you consider confidential. We
                    maintain the privacy of your email address and password submitted to us
                    in the registration process (unless you enter such information as your
                    username or in the text of your entries to user areas), but other
                    information you provide should be considered nonconfidential and
                    available for viewing by others.</p>
                <p>Also, please note that information provided through facebook or other
                    social networks, or for publication on fan pages, mobile apps or
                    websites may be subject to different privacy policies which may vary
                    materially from these terms applying to our web sites.</p>

                <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>

                <p>Any information gathered by us is used to customize the experience
                    for you the user, and is not shared or sold to any third parties,
                    except as expressly provided for in this Privacy Policy and our Terms
                    of Service. However, we may in the future provide customized or
                    targeted advertisements to you based upon your data (including usage
                    statistics and characteristics), in which case we may allow third party
                    applications to access such data for the purpose of customizing
                    messages or advertising for you.</p>

                <div class="section-padding-50"></div>

                <h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>

                <p>To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, we use
                    industry standard methods to safeguard and secure the information we
                    collect online, although you recognize that data transmitted online or
                    stored in a facility to which online access is provided cannot be made
                    to be 100% secure. We believe in protecting your information just as we
                    would want our information protected.</p>
                <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of
                    a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose
                    personal information has been compromised as may be required by
                    applicable law.</p>
                <p>Please note that information you enter for your user profile or in
                    your posts may be accessed and viewed publicly and therefore you should
                    not post information that you consider confidential or that you do not
                    want distributed publicly. Although in some areas you will have the
                    ability to edit or delete information, please note that even this
                    information may have been cached on servers, cut and pasted or
                    otherwise incorporated into other posts or for other uses, and so once
                    information is posted you should consider that it may be publicly
                    available perpetually, and in different locations and/or media than
                    your original submission.</p>

                <h2>Notifications</h2>

                <p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications
                    are required by law or are for marketing or other business related
                    purposes, to our users via email notice, written or hard copy notice,
                    or through conspicuous posting of such notice on a ScreenMe Site, as
                    determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing
                    notifications to our users.</p>

                <h2>Child Protection</h2>

                <p>We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13.
                    In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we
                    will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be
                    children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding
                    accounts.</p>

                <div class="section-padding-50"></div>

                <h2>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h2>

                <p>You can access your personally identifiable information that we
                    collect online and maintain by logging in and "Editing" your account.
                    Your password is needed to edit this information, even if you are
                    already logged in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
                    information. You may not be able to edit or delete past entries and
                    information collected regarding past updates.</p>

                <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
                    steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
                    corrections. The main form of identity management is your email
                    address. Please always use a valid and up-to-date email address.</p>

                <div class="section-padding-50"></div>

                <h2>Use of User Information</h2>

                <p>Information you provide to us about yourself, or that we collect and
                    infer based upon your entries and posts to a ScreenMe Site may be used to
                    improve your user experience, provide or suggest targeted services and
                    to allow third party advertises and messaging to be tailored or
                    targeted. We may use or provide to third parties aggregated data
                    entered by users or inferred from usage. We may collect IP addresses
                    and cookies for the primary purpose of assisting with ease of use by
                    you. However, except as legally required, we will not sell or provide
                    your email address, IP address, cookies, address or phone number to
                    third parties for advertising or other purposes. In the future we may
                    provide third parties with the ability to provide customizable or
                    targeted advertising or messages and in such cases we may allow third
                    party applications to access your user data in determining the
                    messaging or advertising applicable to you.</p>

                <p>ScreenMe is a platform. By nature, our platform helps our customers create
                    interactive marketing campaigns including contests and sweepstakes.

                    campaign as well as ScreenMe's policies. Our customers may choose to transfer your
                    Personal Information into their systems.</p>
